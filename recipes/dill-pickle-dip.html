    <p>This is a great, easy finger appetizer. I came up with it because I love Caprese but it was difficult to serve at large parties. Putting the same ingredients on a toothpick yielded great results.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped dill pickles, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped sweet onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickle juice, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>pinch freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir cream cheese in a bowl with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in dill pickles, onion, pickle juice, dill weed, salt, and pepper until evenly distributed. Refrigerate before serving, at least 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
